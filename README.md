# table_top_maker
 QT Application for managing your table top games
 
# What I'm doing right now

1. Create folder structure of the application   
2. Working on the sqlite integration   
3. Make sure data can be created, deleted and modifed effectively   

# Database.cpp

This is the source I'm mainly working right now. It holds the function that is responsible for database transactions such as
insert, modification and removal.

# World.cpp

World.cpp currently has database transactions function which were there for test, but will be removed as soon as everything works with Database.cpp. The world is basically our database,
as one if its main role is to hold the path of our db that our transactions will be performed on.
