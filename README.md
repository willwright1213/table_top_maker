# table_top_maker
 QT Application for managing your table top games

Tabe Top Maker or simply a Campaign Manager is an application written in C++ with Qt 5 to help DM (Dungeon Master) managing their complex world. The idea came to me because my friend would often recycle the same world for his campaign, and I've been looking for a good project to do while at school.
